Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning in R

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques in R. By analyzing customer data, we identify patterns and build models to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

The dataset used in this project is based on IBM Sample Data Sets and contains various customer attributes, including demographics, account details, and service subscriptions. The goal is to classify customers into "Churn" or "Not Churn" categories.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

Churn Status: Identifies whether a customer left within the last month.

Services Signed Up: Includes phone, internet, online security, backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming services.

Account Details: Contract type, payment method, billing details, monthly and total charges.

Demographics: Gender, age range, partner, and dependent status.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: R

Libraries: tidyverse, caret, h2o, ranger, xgboost, gbm, data.table, ggplot2

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Stacked Models (Ensembling multiple models)

Other advanced algorithms for performance optimization

📈 Key Insights
